# GTK+ Application Template
**Description:** Template for Linux applications using GTK+, written in Vala for Elementary OS.

**Goal:** Reduce workload on future projects by providing a solid boilerplate from which to build apps.
This app won't actually do anything at all, because that's not the point.  The point is just to provide a nice little template.

Feel free to use, as per the terms specified in the license.

**REMEMBER:** Change all instances of the project name to match the actual project name.  You'll find such things in:
- data/*
- po/*
- src/Application.vala
- meson.build
- debian/changelog, control, copyright

**REMEMBER:** Update translations on actual build.
